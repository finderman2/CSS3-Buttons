		    <h1>CSS3 buttons</h1>
		    <p class="intro">This is a small collection of buttons that show what is possible using CSS3, while also maintaining the simplest possible markup. They look best in WebKit-based browsers, not  as good in Firefox, with all other browsers falling back to a less-styled button. If you use these buttons in a project, <a href="mailto:finderman2@gmail.com">drop me a line</a> and let me know.</p>
		    <p>The latest code is located <a href="http://dr.ly/">Here</a></p>
